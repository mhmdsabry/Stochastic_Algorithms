# Stochastic_Algorithms 
 Algorithms that rely on random variables.These algorithms are predominately global optimization
 algorithms and metaheuristics.

 ### Random Search:
 Random Search sample solutions from across the entire search space using a uniform probability distribution.
 It's  derivative-free which means it can be used for non-continuous function too.

### Adaptive Random Search :
The Strategy of the Adaptive Step Size Random Search algorithm is to trial a larger step in each iteration and adopt the larger step if it results in an improvement. Very large step sizes are trialled in the same manner although with a much lower frequency. This strategy of preferring large moves is intended to allow the technique to escape local optima.
