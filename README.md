# Stochastic_Algorithms 
 are algorithms, which relies on random variables.Thesealgorithms are predominately global optimization
 algorithms and metaheuristics.
 
 ### 1- Random Search:
 
 Random Search sample solutions from across the entire search space using a uniform probability distribution.It's  derivative-free
 which means it can be used for non-continuous function too.
